Murang’a University AI Chatbot

Type: AI Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Similarity Matching
Language: TypeScript (Node.js)

🧠 Overview

The Murang’a University AI Chatbot is an intelligent conversational system built to assist users with common queries about Murang’a University of Technology (MUT).

It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and cosine similarity to interpret user input and generate the most relevant response from a predefined knowledge base.

This project demonstrates how simple AI logic can power a rule-based yet intelligent chatbot using TypeScript and TF-IDF-style similarity concepts — ideal for CATs, demos, or academic prototypes.

🎯 Features

✅ Responds intelligently to user questions about MUT (e.g., courses, fees, location).

✅ Handles greetings naturally.

✅ Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for response matching.

✅ Built entirely in TypeScript (with a focus on clean, modular design).

✅ Easily extensible — just add more data to the knowledge base.
